    <h1>Self Improvement</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><h2>Health</h2></li>
            <p>There are many ways that you could improve your physical health. Working out, or being more active is very important. Sitting in a chair all day, and not moving around is not good for you at all, your body wants to move, it needs to move.  </p>
            <hr>
        <li><h2>Mind</h2></li>
            <p>You have to improve the way you think, think more positive. Instead of thinking about all the bad things, think about the good things. Appreciate all the small, positive things about life, stop focusing on bad things going on.</p>
            <hr>
        <li><h2>Diet</h2></li>
            <p>Diet is a very important part of your health, and can impact many parts of your life. Eating healthy isn't as hard as people think, because usually when people think healthy, they think it tastes bad. That is not the case at all.</p>
    </ul>
    <h4>These are not the only ways to improve yourself, just the basics.</h4>
